# Data Processing: UK Biobank

### Processed a batch of thousands of sex-stratified GWAS:
The traits processed were a collection of health and medical related [UK Biobank GWAS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kvPoupSzsSFBNSztMzl04xMoSC3Kcx3CrjVf4yBmESU/edit?usp=sharing). 
We grouped each phenotype into an overarching category based on typcial PheWAS trait categories.

### Software
`Bash`, `R`, `GNOVA` (please see this respository for details on [GNOVA](https://github.com/qlu-lab/GNOVA-2.0))

### Example of Results
After pre-processing, performing sex-aware genetic correlation tests, and plotting results by trait category, a resulting plot should look as displayed below:
